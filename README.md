การทำงานเป็นทีมโดยใช้ GitHub

1. Fork the target repo to your own account.
2. Clone the repo to your local machine.
3. Check out a new "topic branch" and make changes.
4. Push your topic branch to your fork.
5. Use the diff viewer on GitHub to create a pull request via a discussion.
6. Make any requested changes.
7. The pull request is then merged (usually into the master branch) and the topic
branch is deleted from the upstream (target) repo.
